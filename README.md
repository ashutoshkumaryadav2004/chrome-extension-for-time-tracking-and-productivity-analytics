Key Components of this TASK Are:
Chrome Extension:

The extension tracks the time spent on each website by monitoring browser activity.

It classifies websites as productive or unproductive based on predefined rules or user input.

The extension sends the collected data to the backend for storage and analysis.

Backend:

The backend is built using Node.js with Express.js or Python with Flask/Django.

It stores user data, including time spent on websites and productivity classifications.

It provides APIs for the Chrome Extension to send data and for the dashboard to fetch analytics.

Dashboard:

The dashboard is a web application built using React.js or Vue.js.

It visualizes productivity analytics, such as time spent on productive vs. unproductive websites, daily/weekly reports, and trends.

Database:

MongoDB or PostgreSQL is used to store user data and productivity analytics.

Tools and Platforms:
Frontend:

HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For building the Chrome Extension popup and dashboard.

React.js or Vue.js: For building the analytics dashboard.

Backend:

Node.js with Express.js or Python with Flask/Django: For handling API requests and data storage.

Database:

MongoDB: A NoSQL database for flexible data storage.

PostgreSQL: A relational database for structured data storage.

Development Tools:

Visual Studio Code: A code editor for writing and debugging the application.

Git: For version control and collaboration.

Postman: For testing API endpoints.

Deployment:

The backend and dashboard can be deployed on platforms like Heroku, Vercel, or Netlify.
